[Code Dx](https://codedx.com/) is an automated application vulnerability management tool that makes all of your testing tools work together to provide one set of correlated results, then helps you prioritize and manage vulnerabilities â€” integrating with your application lifecycle management tools so your security and development teams work together for faster remediation.

The Code Dx Helm chart creates Kubernetes resources for a secure, production-ready Code Dx deployment and environment. To make the most of this, check that Network Policies and Pod Security Policies are enabled and enforced on your cluster.

**This repository contains various in-depth guides in the [docs](docs) folder, outlined below.**

- [Code Dx Config](docs/codedx-config.md)
- [Code Dx Licensing](docs/codedx-licensing.md)
- [Ingress](docs/ingress.md)
- [Installation Guide](docs/installation-walkthrough.md)
- [Upgrading Code Dx](docs/upgrading.md)

**Sample installation values can be found [here.](sample-values)**

## TL;DR

```
$ helm repo add codedx https://codedx.github.io/codedx-kubernetes
$ helm install codedx/codedx --name codedx
```

We recommend keeping any extra installation options in your own `values.yaml` file and using `helm install/upgrade ... -f my-values.yaml`, to prevent accidental changes to the installation when a configuration property is forgotten or missed. Check out the [example YAML files](sample-values) for common use-cases.

## Prerequisite Details

- Kubernetes 1.8+
- Code Dx license ([purchase](https://codedx.com/purchase-application/) or [request a free trial](https://codedx.com/free-trial/)) 

## Chart Details

This chart will:

- Deploy a Code Dx instance
- Deploy the MariaDB chart with master and slaves
- Create service accounts, PodSecurityPolicies, and NetworkPolicies
- Create Ingress resources as necessary
- Create secrets for your Code Dx license, DB credentials, and default Code Dx Admin credentials

## Installing the Chart

Using this chart requires [Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/), a Kubernetes package manager. You can find instructions for installing and initializing Helm [here](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/).

This chart contains a reference to stable/mariadb chart version 5.5.0, and deploys MariaDB 10.2.22. (Note that "chart version" does not correspond to "app version".)

After installation, you'll be given commands to retrieve the Code Dx admin credentials that were generated. Use `kubectl get pods --watch` to check the status of the Code Dx installation. **Change the Code Dx admin password once installation is complete.** The secret used to get the admin credentials are only used for the first installation of Code Dx, and can change automatically when using `helm upgrade`. After installation and changing the admin password, the secret can be ignored entirely.

A complete installation guide can be found [here.](docs/installation-walkthrough.md)

**Before installing, you should first read the recommendations below.**

### Installation Recommendations

#### values.yaml
For consistency, a custom `values.yaml` file should be used instead of passing each option manually. When using `helm upgrade`, changes are not persisted between runs - if you specify a license file while installing, but don't specify it again when using `helm upgrade`, Helm will delete the license resource from your cluster. Placing your configuration options in a `values.yaml` and passing that each time with `helm upgrade ... -f values.yaml` will simplify the process of making changes.

**Some sample files are available in the [sample-values](sample-values) folder.**

#### MariaDB
When installing the chart in a public-facing environment, be sure to change the passwords for MariaDB Admin and MariaDB Replication. These passwords are not randomly generated and are nontrivial to change after installation. These should be assigned using a `values.yaml` file, either as plaintext, or preferably, in pre-defined secrets. An example of using predefined secrets can be found [here.](sample-values/values-secure-data.yaml)

```
$ helm install codedx/codedx --name codedx --set mariadb.rootUser.password=X --set mariadb.replication.password=Y
```

#### Network Policies and PSPs
It's recommended to leave PodSecurityPolicies and NetworkPolicies enabled for security. Note that controllers need to be available on the cluster to enforce these policies.

#### Volume Sizes
The default volume sizes for Code Dx and MariaDB are `32Gi` - `96Gi` total for the chart, by default. (One volume for Code Dx, one for MariaDB Master, and one for MariaDB Slave.) `32Gi` is not the minimum disk size - the chart can run with a `100Mi` volume for Code Dx and `1Gi` volumes for MariaDB. However, this will quickly fill up and can cause maintenance headaches. Keep in mind that source code, binaries, and scan results will be uploaded to and stored by Code Dx. The size of these files, frequency of scanning, and number of projects should be considered when determining an initial volume size. Expect MariaDB disk usage to be approximately equivalent to Code Dx.

**Depending on the projects being scanned, the default size may not be sufficient. Be sure to specify an appropriate claim size when installing Code Dx.**

#### Replication/Scalability

Code Dx does not officially support horizontal scaling. Attempting to use more than one replica for the Code Dx deployment can lead to bugs while using Code Dx, and possibly corruption of your database. Work is being done within Code Dx to better support this.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall a chart with a `codedx` release name, run the following command (add `--purge` to permit the reuse of the `codedx` release name):

```
$ helm delete codedx
```

To remove the MariaDB persistent volume claims, run the following command:

```
$ kubectl delete pvc data-codedx-mariadb-master-0 data-codedx-mariadb-slave-0
```

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Code Dx chart and their default values.
